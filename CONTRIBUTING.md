### Contributing

There are lots of ways to donate back to the LedgerSMB community, even if you can't 
write computer programs. If you are able to help out with the development, there's 
[a page explaining how to get started](https://ledgersmb.org/content/getting-started-developing).

There are a few other types of contributions we have immediate need for:

* **Support the developers** - If you're not able to contribute to the project by doing any 
of the activities below, please support the developers by becoming a GitHub sponsor. 
See [https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB) for details.
* **Help others** - If you have time to get involved in discussions on the mailing lists, 
IRC channel or other places, supporting other users with the workflows you have worked out 
to work for you, that just might help them get their challenges resolved quickly. 
  * **Testimonials** - sending your [testimonial](https://ledgersmb.org/testimonials) could help others.  Maybe they can help you next time!
  * **Chat** - The main user and developer chat channel is [Matrix](https://ledgersmb.org/content/chat-support-matrix)
  * **Mail list** - While more activity happens on [Matrix](https://ledgersmb.org/content/chat-support-matrix), the [LedgerSMB mail lists](https://lists.ledgersmb.org/mailman3/lists/) are also available.
* **Provide feedback** - Help the developers understand your needs.
  * **Specific Needs** - if you like or dislike specific things, or you have a specific need, let us 
  know through [the mailing lists](https://lists.ledgersmb.org/) or [Matrix](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ledgersmb:matrix.org)! 
  Alternatively, you could start a [discussion on GitHub]    
  (https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/discussions/categories/ideas)
  * **Bug reports** - Please report your problems in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/issues) or ask your 
questions in a [GitHub Discussion (Q&A category)](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/discussions/categories/q-a).
* **Localization**
  * **Translations** - We always need help with translations. More details about translations can 
  be found [here](https://ledgersmb.org/community-guide/community-guide/translating).
  * **Tax rules** - While we cover a lot of countries we can always use review and additions to our 
  tax functions.
  * **Chart of accounts** - Our chart of accounts are localized and always in need of review 
  and improvmeents. See the [examples here](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/tree/master/locale/coa).
  * **Regulatory compliance** - While we cover a lot of countries we can always use review
   and additions to our to our regulatory compliance functions.
* **Documentation**
  * **FAQ items** - We can always use additions or updates to our [FAQ](https://ledgersmb.org/faq) pages.
  * **Book content** - The [user focused book](https://book.ledgersmb.org) needs non-technical writers to review and 
  improve it. 
* **Release Testing** - Help preventing regressions by testing your processes with any release
candidates announced on the [LedgerSMB mail lists](https://lists.ledgersmb.org/mailman3/lists/). If we catch regressions before a release, we can
fix the problems and prevent problematic releases. Also, there are too many possible 
combinations of Perl, PostgreSQL, Apache, etc versions to test them all; just maybe, 
your combination is a problematic one. *If so: we want to know about it before the release!*
* **Create a package for your O/S** - You can help our market penetration by developing a 
package for your favorite distribution or operating system, if one isn't already available.
* **Code** - Of course we can always use developers especially with skills in Perl, PostgreSQL, HTML, 
JavaScript and Gherkin.
  * **Code & Project Standards** - An index of project's important architecture and coding decisions 
    is located in the [Architecture Design Records index](doc/adr/index.md).

## Community roles

Our definition of "the LedgerSMB community" is to include

* Those who create the software: Developers, Testers, Translators, Packagers
* Those who help others use (set up, configure, administer) the software: Contributors
* Those who test and use the software: Users

This definition does not include those who sell LedgerSMB (related) services and
products (in their role of seller). If we include those in the definition, we'd call
that "the LedgerSMB ecosystem".

A listing of people who have contributed at one time or another can be found in the
[CONTRIBUTORS file](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) and
[the git repository history](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/graphs/contributors)
which may be found in the source distribution archive or in the
source code repository. Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide insight into contributors
to issues and discussions.

### Code Of conduct

Within this community, we live by [the Ubuntu code of conduct](https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0).
Apart from that, there are no restrictions on becoming a community member in the
role of any of the above. Simply join one of the mailing lists and submit your
contributions.

### Governance

The project is governed by the Core Team. Each Core Team member (in his or her role of
Core Team member) is expected - regardless of employment or commercial interests - to act
on behalf of the shared interests we have as a project. New Core Team membership is
extended to community members by invitation from the Core Team. Core Team membership is
terminated upon stepping down of the Core Team member, e.g. if he or she feels not being
up to the task.

Core Team members differ from other community members in that they have assumed the
additional responsibility to nurture the project and look after the community's shared
interests. So far, these have been understood to be a number of things:

* Decide where and how we want project resources to be hosted (thinking of the project
 website http://ledgersmb.org/, etc)
* If and when people would like to make large contributions, we discuss if and under
  what terms we want to accept those  
  Examples of contributions meant under this item include industry customizations and
  in-house parallel developments being submitted for (re)integration
* Vote on whether releases are ready to be released or not

The [current members of the core team](https://github.com/orgs/ledgersmb/teams/core) are listed on GitHub.
