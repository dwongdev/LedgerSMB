## Getting involved


### Social media contacts

The ledgerSMB project monitors the following social media platforms. Feel free to reach out with any questions.

* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@LedgerSMB)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LedgerSMB)
* [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/LedgerSMB)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13199807/)
* [Matrix (routine development)](https://app.element.io/#/room/#ledgersmb:matrix.org)

## Community roles

Our definition of "the LedgerSMB community" is to include

* Those who create the software: Developers, Testers, Translators, Packagers
* Those who help others use (set up, configure, administer) the software: Contributors
* Those who test and use the software: Users

This definition does not include those who sell LedgerSMB (related) services and
products (in their role of seller). If we include those in the definition, we'd call
that "the LedgerSMB ecosystem".

Within this community, we live by [the Ubuntu code of conduct](https://launchpad.net/codeofconduct/2.0).
Apart from that, there are no restrictions on becoming a community member in the
role of any of the above. Simply join one of the mailing lists and submit your
contributions.

A listing of people who have contributed at one time or another can be found in the
[CONTRIBUTORS file](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) and
[the git repository history](https://github.com/ledgersmb/LedgerSMB/graphs/contributors)
which may be found in the source distribution archive or in the
source code repository. Unfortunately, GitHub does not provide insigt into contributors
to issues and discussions.

### Governance

The project is governed by the Core Team. Each Core Team member (in his or her role of
Core Team member) is expected - regardless of employment or commercial interests - to act
on behalf of the shared interests we have as a project. New Core Team membership is
extended to community members by invitation from the Core Team. Core Team membership is
terminated upon stepping down of the Core Team member, e.g. if he or she feels not being
up to the task.

Core Team members differ from other community members in that they have assumed the
additional responsibility to nurture the project and look after the community's shared
interests. So far, these have been understood to be a number of things:

* Decide where and how we want project resources to be hosted (thinking of the project
 website http://ledgersmb.org/, etc)
* If and when people would like to make large contributions, we discuss if and under
  what terms we want to accept those  
  Examples of contributions meant under this item include industry customizations and
  in-house parallel developments being submitted for (re)integration
* Vote on whether releases are ready to be released or not

The [current members of the core team](https://github.com/orgs/ledgersmb/teams/core) are listed on GitHub.
