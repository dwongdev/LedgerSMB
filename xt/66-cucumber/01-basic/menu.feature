Feature: correct operation of the menu and immediate linked pages
  As an end-user, I want to be able to navigate the menu and open
  the screens from the available links. If my authorizations
  don't allow a specific screen, I expect the links not to be in
  the menu.



Background:
  Given a standard test company
  Given a logged in admin


#Scenario Outline: Navigate to menu and open tab
#   When I navigate the menu and select the item at "<path>"
#   And I select the "<tab>" tab
#   Then I should see the <screen> tab
#  Examples:
#    | path                                      | screen                   | tab           |
#    | Contacts > Add Contact                    | contact creation         | Company       |
##    | Contacts > Add Contact                    | contact creation         | Person        |
##    | General Journal > Year End                | year-end                 | Close Year    |
##    | General Journal > Year End                | year-end                 | Close Period  |
##    | General Journal > Year End                | year-end                 | Ro-open Books |
